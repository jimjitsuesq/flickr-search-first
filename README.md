## General Information

* This was the seventh project in my Team Treehouse Full-Stack JavaScript Tech Degree bootcamp program.
* I received a grade of "Exceeds Expectations" (the highest available).
* Uses Axios to make asynchronous requests from Flickr.
* Uses React Router to track, manipulate and harness the browser history to allow users to browse back and forth through their searches.

The app was originally written in React's older "class" syntax, but after completing the Treehouse bootcamp I completely rewrote it using more modern React Hooks. This challenge was a way to get more practice using these newer functions, to better understand "state" and to streamline the app for deployment.
